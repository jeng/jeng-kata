The alien sent a message. But it's encrypted. The first step is to unzip it. Here's how.
ABCD -> ABCD
AB[3CD] -> ABCDCDCD
AB[2[3CD]] -> ABCDCDCD
IF[2E]LG[5O]D -> IFEELGOOOOOD
AB[2C[2EF]G] -> ABCEFEFGCEFEFG
The rules are simple:
There will only be captical letter, numbers and brackets('[' and ']') in the message.
When there's a block of code inside brackets, such as [39ABC], it means you need to repeat the letters(ABC) n(39) times.
The blocks might be embeded multiple layers.
You final message will only consists of capital letters.
The blocks, when they apear, will always follow the correct format, so you don't have to validate it.
