Write ary_take function, that takes an array ary, ary_size - the size of the array, value n - the number of first elements to take, and a pointer to an unsigned integer res_size, and does the following:
returns a subarray with n elements if 0 < n < ary_size
returns NULL if n == 0
returns a copy of the array ary if n >= ary_size
In all cases res_size must be set to the size of the resulting subarray.
if n == 0, res_size must also be set to 0.
if n >= ary_size, res_size must be set to ary_size.
if 0 < n < ary_size, res_size must be set to n.
Examples:
For array { 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 } and n = 3, return { 0, 1, 1 } and set res_size to 3.
For array { 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 } and n = 0, return NULL and set res_size to 0.
For array { 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 } and n = 255 return the copy of the array and set res_size to its size, in this case it's 6.
