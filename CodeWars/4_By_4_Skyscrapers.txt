In a grid of 4 by 4 squares you want to place a skyscraper in each square with only some clues:
The height of the skyscrapers is between 1 and 4
No two skyscrapers in a row or column may have the same number of floors
A clue is the number of skyscrapers that you can see in a row or column from the outside
Higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them

Can you write a program that can solve this puzzle?

Example:

To understand how the puzzle works, this is an example of a row with 2 clues. Seen from the left side there are 4 buildings visible while seen from the right side only 1:

 4                      1

There is only one way in which the skyscrapers can be placed. From left-to-right all four buildings must be visible and no building may hide behind another building:

 4  1  2  3  4  1

Example of a 4 by 4 puzzle with the solution:

              1  2   
                                  2
 1               
                            3      

          1  2   
    2  1  4  3   
    3  4  1  2  2
 1  4  2  3  1   
    1  3  2  4   
          3      

Task:

Finish:
public static int[][] SolvePuzzle(int[] clues)
Pass the clues in an array of 16 items. This array contains the clues around the clock, index:
    0  1    2    3   
 15              4
 14              5
 13              6
 12              7
   11 10  9  8   
If no clue is available, add value `0`
Each puzzle has only one possible solution
`SolvePuzzle()` returns matrix `int[][]`. The first indexer is for the row, the second indexer for the column. (Python: returns 4-tuple of 4-tuples, Ruby: 4-Array of 4-Arrays)
If you finished this kata you can use your solution as a base for the more challenging kata: 6 By 6 Skyscrapers
