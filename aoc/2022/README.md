I wanted to add more constraints to this by only using stb to solve the puzzles.  It is funny how much you can accomplish with a lexer and a state machine.  I didn't get finished with this before Christmas since it is hard to find time during the holidays to work on this everyday.  But I'm still working through it on days when I have some free time.
